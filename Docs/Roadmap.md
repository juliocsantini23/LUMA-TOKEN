# LumaChain – Technical Roadmap

This roadmap describes, at a high level, the main planned phases for the development of the **LumaChain (LUMA)** ecosystem.  
Dates and milestones are indicative and may change according to technical progress, regulation and market conditions.

---

## Phase 1 – Token Foundation (Completed / Ongoing)

- Deployment of the **LUMA** token on the Polygon PoS network  
- Initial liquidity setup on a DEX  
- Creation of **timelock** contracts for:
  - Team & Development  
  - Treasury & Ecosystem  
- Publication of:
  - Whitepaper  
  - Tokenomics  
  - Transparency documents  
  - Public repository with contracts and data  

**Goal:** establish a transparent, auditable and secure base for the token.

---

## Phase 2 – Integrations & Listings

- Technical integration with:
  - wallets compatible with Polygon  
  - block explorers and analytics platforms  
  - price-tracking and market-cap platforms  
- Providing technical documentation for:
  - DEXs  
  - CEXs  
  - indexers and aggregators  
- Automation of on-chain data:
  - periodic supply updates  
  - liquidity-pool monitoring  
  - public read endpoints (when applicable)  

**Goal:** make the token easy to list and integrate across the Web3 ecosystem.

---

## Phase 3 – LumaNetwork (Core Infrastructure)

- Design of **LumaNetwork** as the core infrastructure layer of the ecosystem  
- Definition of the architecture and technical standards to be used by future modules  
- Exploration of scalability, fees and interoperability options within Polygon and the broader EVM ecosystem  
- Preparation for RealFi-oriented and payment-oriented products to run on top of this infrastructure  

**Goal:** create a solid, scalable and interoperable base layer for the LumaChain ecosystem.

---

## Phase 4 – LumaPay (Payments Infrastructure)

- Design of a payment module using LUMA as a settlement asset  
- Creation of auxiliary contracts (if needed) for:
  - recurring payments  
  - payment splits  
  - merchant / partner integrations  
- Integration with partner products and services, including use cases connected to LumaNetwork  

**Goal:** enable LUMA to be used for payments, especially in solutions connected to the real economy and to LumaNetwork-based applications.

---

## Phase 5 – RealFi (Penultimate Phase)

- Development of **RealFi** modules focused on real-world financial use cases, such as:
  - tokenization of revenue streams and cash flows  
  - models linked to real-world assets (e.g. properties and income-generating operations)  
- Exploration of compliant structures for:
  - receivables  
  - management contracts  
  - tokenized claims on future cash flows  
- Use of LumaNetwork and LumaPay as underlying infrastructure for RealFi flows  

**Goal:** bring the LumaChain ecosystem closer to concrete applications in traditional markets, leveraging LumaNetwork and the payment rails of LumaPay.

---

## Phase 6 – Tools for Community & Developers (Final Phase in this Roadmap)

- SDKs and code examples for integrating with:
  - the LUMA token  
  - LumaNetwork  
  - LumaPay  
  - RealFi modules  
- Advanced documentation for developers  
- Community-facing tools for on-chain data monitoring and analytics  
- Support for third-party integrations and ecosystem projects  

**Goal:** encourage building on top of LumaChain and make it easy for integrators, partners and the community to interact with the ecosystem.
